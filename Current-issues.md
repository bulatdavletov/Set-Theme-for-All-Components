- [x] Applied to 0 - make this message more friendly with 0 case. We already have it in UI version. Copy from there.
    - Write shorter and nicer message.
- [x] Log all checked layers name in the console
- [x] Show only one final message after all is done:
    If updated > 0: "✅ Updated X/N" (where X is updated count, N is total themed components)
    If updated = 0: "🌚 Everything already Dark" or "☀️ Everything already Light"
    If nothing to update and nothing already themed: No message
